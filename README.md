# Trackr

## What is it?
Trackr is going to be a webapp that can be used to find more information about a list of games. The list of games comes from [RAWG's](https://rawg.io/apidocs) game database.

## Why?
This webapp is meant for portfolio purposes. After watching hours of tutorials, it's time to cement some knowledge.
